# AI Operating System Kernel

## Overview
The **AI Operating System Kernel** serves as the foundational layer of the AI OS. It manages core system functions, including task scheduling, resource allocation, and process isolation. Designed to ensure optimal performance and security, the kernel is responsible for managing the low-level interactions between hardware and software, enabling the AI OS to efficiently handle both gaming and AI computational tasks.

## Key Features
- **Task Scheduling**: Prioritizes real-time processes like AI-driven tasks while ensuring overall system responsiveness.
- **Resource Management**: Efficiently allocates memory, CPU, and other system resources.
- **Process Isolation and Security**: Implements sandboxing and memory protection to prevent unauthorized access between processes.
- **Device Driver Interface**: Manages input/output devices, networking, and storage.

## Technology Stack
- **Language**: Rust (for performance and memory safety)
- **Build System**: Cargo (Rustâ€™s build tool)
- **Documentation**: Markdown (docs folder)

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
